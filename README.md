# Movies Listing with ReactJS

This is the movies project. It's related to the challenge for a mid-level role, as a developer.

We are using ClojureScript's wrap on `ReactJS`. Therefore, we are using `Reagent`.

## Structure

We will:

- List a top 10 movies list.
- Order them by either: **Year-decreasing**, **Title-alphabetically**, or by **Contry-alphabetically**

## What a Movie contains

- Title.
- Director.
- Country of Origin.
- Year (released).
- Image (representing the movie).

## TODO: Deploy

Host somewhere; options:

- Firebase.
- Github pages.

Also allowed, but not preferential:

- Just share the github repo.
